For part 3, you will design and implement a feature that allows users to subscribe to available corporate blog. Users must be able to search for all available corporate blog they want by entering a searching string (e.g. corporate or service name), returning a listing, select a blog to subscribe to, and then complete the subscription (for this part, just 'confirming' a subscribe will suffice -- there is no need to emulate a payment system). Users can request for canceling their subscription to a blog, and only administrators can approve any cancelation requests.
